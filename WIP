Work-in-progress 
(Almost the same as "TODO" except it's actually being done).

- Figure out configure-bug with EOM ?
- Short-opts
- Time-limited execution

Usage and rationale:
	Lines starting with - are parsed int WIP.h and printed when spew is
	run, so keep them C-safe (no " in other words). The idea is to
	remind devs what they(we) planned and what's actually happening
	without opening a file. If the list gets too long, it gets annoying
	and you are motivated to finish some items, remove some items that
	can wait or otherwise condense the list.

	It's an experiment. Let's see how it turns out :)
